# space-weather (reactJS)

#### [active vanillaJS demo](https://adoring-kirch-638f40.netlify.app/) (react version currently under construction)

##### Educational app for high school / college students to view and learn about space weather events in real-time. easily view & access NASA space weather database in real-time.

##### The goal of this project is to create a simple-to-use, dashboard which summarizes real-time 'space-weather' events. It is intended to push the viewer into reading the additional materials (under construction) and videos (also under construction) in order to understand various space weather events. Project is also intended to assist K-12 teachers in teaching related [NGSS standards](https://www.nextgenscience.org/topic-arrangement/1space-systems-patterns-and-cycles).

##### There has been a large push in US education in the past 10 years to standardize and promote space education from a national level. New Generation Science Standards (NGSS), along with [Common Core Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative) have been passed into law from 2011 to 2015 at a federal level.

##### However, educational resources to support the educational standards have been lacking at times, despite the wealth of data available on space from agencies like NASA and NOAA, and others. 

##### Fortunately NASA and other national space agencies provide a wealth of fascinating and real-time updates on space-weather events via API access at [DONKI](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/support/DONKI-webservices.php) and various other APIs.

##### Interesting examples of API access data include space trash via [Canadian Astronomy Data Centre Archive](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/open-data/api.asp) and R[over Environmental Monitoring Station (on Mars!)](http://cab.inta-csic.es/rems/index.html)

# How-to-use:

### Solar Page:

##### Events based on activity of the Sun's Surface. Examples include solar flares, and 'surface-eruption-type' events. Data is from DONKI api. User is expected to be unfamilar with most Solar Weather Events. Educational pages for each solar event are currently under construction. 

### Mars Page:

##### (currently under construction) This page is intended to draw on the 3 mars rover missions to provide a general analysis of martian weather. It is common for the rovers to be unavailable for weeks or months at a time during martian 'dust-storms'. Lack of data will be addressed as an educational opportunity.
