# space-weather (reactJS)

## [active release](https://www.expspaceweather.com/) (ready for use)

##### Educational app for high school / college students to view and learn about space weather events in real-time. easily view & access NASA space weather database in real-time.

##### The goal of this project is to create a simple-to-use, dashboard which summarizes real-time 'space-weather' events. It is intended to push the viewer into reading the additional materials (under construction) and videos (also under construction) in order to understand various space weather events. Project is also intended to assist high school teachers & undergraduate lecturers in teaching related [NGSS space standards](https://www.nextgenscience.org/topic-arrangement/hsspace-systems).

##### There has been a large push in US education in the past 10 years to standardize and promote space education from a national level. New Generation Science Standards (NGSS), along with [Common Core Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative) have been passed into law from 2011 to 2015 at a federal level.

##### However, educational resources to support the educational standards have been lacking at times, despite the wealth of data available on space from agencies like NASA and NOAA, and others. 

##### Fortunately NASA and other national space agencies provide a wealth of fascinating and real-time updates on space-weather events via API access at [DONKI](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/support/DONKI-webservices.php) and various other APIs.

##### Interesting examples of API access data include space trash via [Canadian Astronomy Data Centre Archive](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/open-data/api.asp) and R[over Environmental Monitoring Station (on Mars!)](http://cab.inta-csic.es/rems/index.html)

# How-to-use:

### Solar Page:

##### Events based on activity of the Sun's Surface. Examples include solar flares, and 'surface-eruption-type' events. Data is from DONKI api. User is expected to be unfamilar with most Solar Weather Events. Educational pages for each solar event are currently under construction. 

### Tutorial Page:
##### - Tutorial 1-3: These video lessons and quizzes get the user familiar with the concepts needed to understand the space weather displayed on the "weather" page.
##### - Bonus 1-3: The bonus lessons target NGSS (US Educational) standards and other interesting side topics of astronomy including an orbit simulation.
##### - Big Bang 1-3: The big bang series focuses on the Big Bang NGSS standards.

### Educators Page:

##### The [educators page](https://www.expspaceweather.com/educators) is essentially an faq and help page for teachers who wish to use the website in lesson planning.
